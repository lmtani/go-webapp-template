# Go webapp template

I aim to put the frontend inside the Go binary (using embed) to make it easy to distribute. I'm using [sausheong/invadersapp](https://github.com/sausheong/invadersapp) as a starter point.

### Todo

- [x] Embed ui files in Go
- [ ] Work in index.html to make it better
- [ ] (Maybe) Add React
